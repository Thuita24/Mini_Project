# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing image of a bowling alley. Key
elements include:
• A wooden bowling lane with a wood grain effect.
• A bowling ball with a 3D appearance and finger holes.
• Six bowling pins positioned in a triangular formation with red stripes for realism.
# Requirements
• Python 3.x
• cairo graphics library for Python
# Setup and Installation
To run this code, you'll need to install the cairo library. Follow these steps:
1. Install the Cairo development libraries:
o Linux: Run sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev (Ubuntu/Debian)
o Mac: Install via Homebrew: brew install cairo
o Windows: Download and install from the Cairo website
2. Install pycairo (Python binding for Cairo) using pip:
3. bash
Copy code
pip install pycairo
Code Explanation
Lane Background
The wooden lane is created with alternating shades of brown to simulate wooden planks.
Bowling Ball
A radial gradient provides a 3D effect, with darker edges and a light red highlight to mimic
lighting. Three finger holes are drawn on the ball with shadow gradients.
Pins
Pins are arranged in a triangular formation at the top of the lane. Each pin consists of a
white body with a rounded top and two red stripes.
Running the Project
1. Ensure the output directory (Output) exists, or create it in the same directory as the
code.
2. Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python bowling_scene.py
3. The rendered image will be saved as Output/BowlingAlleyWithBall.png.
4. Output
The generated image shows a 3D bowling ball on a wooden lane with six bowling pins at the
top.
